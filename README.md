# EpiK Protocol Metaverse SDK

Hello, all EPKers! 
This project aims to reduce the costs of developing metaverse games in Ethereum / BSC with EPK token.

## Our Goals

We hope all game developers in EpiK Protocol ecosystem can focus on the game design and implementation without spending a lot of time to learn how to write smart contract and spending a lot of money to audit these general codes.

As for a game developer, you can use our sdk to deploy all general smart contracts within 5 minutes. These smart contracts will allow your users to

1. buy NFT blind boxes with USDT or EPK
2. open NFT blind boxes to get all kinds of NFTs in your games
3. stake their NFTs to earn EPK in the reward pool in your games

Moreover, these smart contracts provide the ability for you to configure the parameters and customize the rule about how to distribute rewards in your NFT staking pool. If you have more good ideas about this sdk, please submit [PR](https://github.com/BoredApeIvan/epik-metaverse-sdk/pulls) in this repo using the title with the prefix [ADVICE].
